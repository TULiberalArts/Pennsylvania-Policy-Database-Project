## What is the Pennsylvania Policy Database?
The Pennsylvania Policy Database Project at Temple University is a free, online resource that provides access to more than 200,000  state and news media records and enables users to trace and analyze with a few mouse clicks the history of public policy in the Commonwealth since 1979.  Designed for easy use by educators, students, researchers, policy makers, news reporters, and the general public, it is the first comprehensive state policy database of its kind.

Designed for easy use by educators, students, researchers, policymakers, journalists, and the general public, it is the first comprehensive state policy database of its kind. To access the database, please use the Data Analysis Tool.
Faculty-supervised students built the project at Temple University and five other universities with the support and cooperation of the Pennsylvania General Assembly. Also participating were students and faculty members at Pennsylvania State University, Carnegie Mellon University, the University of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania State University Harrisburg, and the University of Pennsylvania.

The Pennsylvania project follows the methodological approach of the national [Policy Agendas database](www.policyagendas.org), which allows users to track and analyze federal policy since 1946. Created by political scientists Frank R. Baumgartner and Bryan D. Jones and funded initially by the National Science Foundation, the University of Texas houses the national project. Similar databases are under construction in a dozen foreign countries as a part of the Comparative Agendas Project. Learn More.
