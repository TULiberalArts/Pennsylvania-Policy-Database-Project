## How is this database different from traditional government archives?
The database provides researchers with superior tools for both information retrieval, a goal of most official archives, and pattern recognition, which is often difficult to uncover without spending immense amounts of time and effort studying and classifying hundreds if not thousands of records in numerous agency archives. The Pennsylvania Policy Database files all state, public opinion, government spending, and news media records in exclusive and exhaustive categories. It is also consistently organized over time. It allows users not only to locate essential documents but to recognize and graphically display patterns of policy development across many issue areas, many policy-making venues, and many years. Users can quickly identify turning points and shifts in public attention between policy areas and significant increases or declines in activity as reflected in legislation, governors’ speeches, court decisions, state spending, or media reporting as elected officials track it. All records or abstracts of documents also can be instantly downloaded for further detailed analysis.

adding a line in to as an easter egg.

## What records are included and how was it built?
The database includes House and Senate bills and resolutions, acts, legislative hearings, governors’ budget messages, governors’ executive orders, state expenditures, news reports from across the state, Governing magazine articles, public opinion polls, legislative studies, and Pennsylvania Supreme Court decisions. Working under the supervision of faculty leaders, students at the participating universities abstracted and coded these records into 21 major and more than 200 minor topic areas, using definitions and decision rules created for the national database. Although keyword search is provided as a supplemental feature, it is not the primary tool for either coding or finding records, as it is in many traditional archives. Keyword search tools require researchers to guess at the terminology to use (including the proper spelling, capitalization, etc.) and are vulnerable to changes in the meaning of terms over time. Rather, two student workers read and double-blind coded each record working independently, or with one student and a computer using specially created policy coding software. If necessary, a graduate student serving as research manager breaks tie votes. The Commonwealth’s expenditures follow the same major policy topics coding as the other records. Total state spending and general fund balances or deficits are available in constant or current dollars. The project covers the years from 1979 to the most recently completed two-year session of the legislature.

## What are the project’s benefits?
The project supplements existing state information-retrieval systems and is consistent with public demands for increased transparency. State policymakers and aides can more efficiently research recurring issues and previously-tried solutions, avoiding the need to reinvent the wheel. The integration of government records, news accounts, and opinion data can help students, educators, and policymakers gain insights into the underlying causes and politics of issues. The project’s comparability with the national database facilitates insights into federal-state policy relationships. The project provides a central index to different kinds of state records and therefore offers staffers and archivists with a new tool to respond to public inquiries. It outlines a comprehensible, “no-spin” history of an institution – the legislature – whose policy and “PR” outputs reflect partisan debate and conflict but leave the larger institutional story untold. It also codes and provides abstracts and access to the top decision-makers in the other two branches, the governor, and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.

We also believe the project can help correct a long-standing imbalance in both scholarship and public understanding. The state role in American public policy is under-studied in universities, under-reported by the news media, and not well understood by the general public. Scholars and the news media have paid far more attention to national and urban public policy, perhaps partly because many state capitals are remote from the central campuses of major universities and major metropolitan news outlets.

## Acknowledgements
Construction of the database was made possible by funding from the Pennsylvania General Assembly, a grant from the Department of Community and Economic Development, and by in-kind contributions by the participating universities, including faculty time and overhead costs. Virtually all project funds have directly supported students at Temple and the other participating universities. The database now is maintained solely with Temple University funds.

From its inception, the project has benefitted enormously from support provided by senior staff officers of the General Assembly and from assistance provided by many other individuals with state agencies, some of whom are still active and some of whom have assumed other positions in public or private life or have retired.
